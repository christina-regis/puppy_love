  <h3>Lucy's perfect date</h3>
      <p>Lucy loves playing and tearing apart soft fluffy toys.
      She would enjoy long slow walks where she can stop often to smell the roses, or another dogs mark.
      She can be very mellow and just enjoy a day at home with her best friends but is generall active
      and doesn't want to be left out of activities.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you can appreciate a well rounded dog and are ready for anything, contact Lucy!
